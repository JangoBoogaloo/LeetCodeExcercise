# LeetCodeExcercise

## How to use this repo

Most of the solutions are implemented in C# and Python (Python 3). Suggest open it with `Rider` and `PyCharm`.

### [Pull Request](https://github.com/JangoBoogaloo/LeetCodeExcercise/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged)

* Each [pull request](https://github.com/JangoBoogaloo/LeetCodeExcercise/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged) should represent a leetcode question. It provides description/label/hint/solution.

## [Issue](https://github.com/JangoBoogaloo/LeetCodeExcercise/issues)

* Each issue is a summary of a concept and provide hints and common tricks of this concept.
* Select its label you can find all the relevent questions for that issue.

## [Label](https://github.com/JangoBoogaloo/LeetCodeExcercise/labels)

This repo is designed to practice leetcode questions base on topics. 

For example if you are not familiar with `backtrack`. You can filter by [`backtrack`](https://github.com/JangoBoogaloo/LeetCodeExcercise/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+label%3Abacktrack) label pull requests to find questions of this topic.

## TODO

### Support more languages

It's always an interesting topic to see how an algorithm/solution can be implemented in a different language. Sometimes an elegant/efficent algorithm in one language can be difficult or even impossible to implement in another language.
For practice purpose using Python is very efficient, but I definitely support implementing them in other languages (Java, C++, or even Rust).

At one point I will pause adding new questions and review existing questions. I will start supporting different languages by that time. 

ETA in 2025.

### Test Case

While writing test cases will be a great practice and make the repo self-contained, it's not very efficient for 1st time leetcode practice. Again I will come back making test cases in my review time. 

ETA in 2025
