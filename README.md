# LeetCodeExcercise

## How to use this repo

* Each pull request and branch should represent a leetcode question. It provides description/label/hint/solution.
* Most of the solutions are implemented in C# and Python (mostly Python 3). Suggest open it with `Rider` and `Pycharm`.
* Issues represent some important topics for review. Go select its label you can find all the relevent questions for that issue.

This repo is design to practice leetcode questions base on topics. For example if you are not familiar with `Sliding Window`. You can filter by `sliding window` label to learn and practice this topic.
Test cases are not written ATM as relying on leetcode test case is much more efficient.

## TODO

### Support more languages

It's always an interesting topic to see how an algorithm/solution can be implemented in a different language. Sometimes an elegant/efficent algorithm in one language can be difficult or even impossible to implement in another language.
For practice purpose using Python is very efficient, but I definitely support implementing them in other languages (Java, C++, or even Rust).

A one point I will pause adding new questions and review existing questions. I will start supporting different languages by that time. ETA in 2025.

### Test Case

While writing test cases will be a great practice and make the repo self-contained, it's not very efficient for 1st time leetcode practice. Again I will come back making test cases in my review time. ETA in 2025
