# LeetCodeExcercise

## How to use this repo

Most of the solutions are implemented in Python (Python 3). Suggest open it with [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/?source=google&medium=cpc&campaign=AMER_en_CA_PyCharm_Branded&term=pycharm&content=698987581431&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA4rK8BhD7ARIsAFe5LXISzVE80TBr4oJV7w-nKm8gX2kGQZ5KqO5lWFwIpmoZQhVodAOd_eMaAlCMEALw_wcB).

### [Pull Request](https://github.com/JangoBoogaloo/LeetCodeExcercise/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged)

* Each [pull request](https://github.com/JangoBoogaloo/LeetCodeExcercise/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+-label%3Atestcase+) should represent a leetcode question. It provides description/label/hint/solution.

### [Issue](https://github.com/JangoBoogaloo/LeetCodeExcercise/issues)

* Each issue is a summary of a concept and provide hints and common tricks of this concept.
* Select its label you can find all the relevent questions for that issue.

### [Label](https://github.com/JangoBoogaloo/LeetCodeExcercise/labels)

This repo is designed to practice leetcode questions base on topics. 

For example if you are not familiar with `backtrack`. You can filter by [`backtrack`](https://github.com/JangoBoogaloo/LeetCodeExcercise/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+-label%3Atestcase+label%3Abacktrack) label pull requests to find questions of this topic.

### [Test Case](https://github.com/JangoBoogaloo/LeetCodeExcercise/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3Atestcase)
[Test Case](https://github.com/JangoBoogaloo/LeetCodeExcercise/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3Atestcase) PR should only contains test cases and no solution implementation. It is for practicing test creation.

## TODO

### Support more languages - ETA in 2025

It's always an interesting topic to see how an algorithm/solution can be implemented in a different language. Sometimes an elegant/efficent algorithm in one language can be difficult or even impossible to implement in another language.
For practice purpose using Python is very efficient, but implementing them in other languages (Java, C++, or even Rust) is definitely a good next TODO.

### Test Case (WIP)

While writing test cases will be a great practice and make the repo self-contained, it's not very efficient for 1st time leetcode practice. Again I will come back making test cases in my review time. 

ETA in 2025
